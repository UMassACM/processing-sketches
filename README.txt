Processing.org Sketches

Processing.org is an open source app designed for “code sketching” for
interactivity, art, music, visualization, and more. Check it out at
http://processing.org!

Since much of the UMass CS programming curriculum is based on Java,
Processing.org is helpful to learn since it is a Java dialect that’s friendly to
newcomers and capable enough for the advanced. It’s also a fun way to learn or
practice programming and impress your friends haha.

Processing.org works on Linux, OS X, and Windows.
